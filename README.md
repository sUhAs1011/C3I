The skills gap is a significant challenge for job seekers. Many
individuals lack the specific skills required for available
positions, leading to unemployment and underemployment,
so our model aims to solve this issue by analyzes a user's
resume and recommends relevant online courses to bridge
their skill gaps and improve their career prospects.

### PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
- We are planning to integrate LLM(Large Language Model) into our model as LLM
can help in dynamic job skill identification as well helps in improved course
recommendation.
- We are planning to use vector database as, vector embeddings capture the
semantic meaning and also they help efficient information retrieval.
- Planning to extract skills from the pdf using python modules like fitz or use
OCR(Optical Character Recognition)
- Use streamlit/tkinter for web interface, for enhanced and user friendly
interaction.
- Extract job postings and skill_enhancement courses from authenticated websites
like kaggle, O*NET Database or google dataset search.
